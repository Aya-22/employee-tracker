# employee-tracker

## The main focus of this project is to create a employee tracker system using SQL.

The first step taken was to create the database using sql. After creating the database, I created 3 different tables that were linked with primary and foreign keys. I did include seeds for each table but since I did not finsih the code it was not included in the video. Then I installed the npm package and once the packages were installed I worked on framework for a server, as we learned in class earlier in the week. Reviewing the past activities was really helpful with this homework assignment. I worked on the get, post, and delete functions for the server. I am still working on this code.
